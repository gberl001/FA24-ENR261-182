# Final Project: Engineering Design Toolbox

**Objective:**

Create a GUI-based application that integrates the engineering tools developed during the course. Students will implement core features and extend functionality by selecting additional tools.

## Core Requirements **(Mandatory)**

The following base features are required:
1. Stress-Strain Calculator
	* Calculate stress and strain values based on user input (e.g., force, cross-sectional area, material properties).
	* Validate inputs and display results in a clear format.
2. Material Database
	* Include a database of common materials with properties (e.g., Young’s modulus, yield strength).
	* Allow users to select materials from a dropdown and use these properties in calculations.
3. Data Visualization
	* Plot stress-strain curves based on calculated or provided data.
	* Include customization options for axis limits, titles, and labels.
4. GUI Integration
	* Create a GUI with tabs or sections for:
      * Input and calculation.
      * Material database management.
      * Algorithm plotting.

## Additional Features **(Choose 4)**

Select and implement three additional features from the following list:
1. Beam Analysis Tool
	* Calculate bending moments, shear forces, and deflections for simple beams.
	* Include a visual representation of the beam with loading and support conditions.
2. Thermal Stress Calculator
	* Compute thermal stresses based on temperature changes and material coefficients.
	* Integrate results with the material database.
3. Fatigue Analysis
	* Perform fatigue calculations using S-N curves.
	* Include functionality to visualize fatigue life for a given material.
4. Optimization Tool
	* Allow users to optimize cross-sectional dimensions (e.g., minimize weight while meeting strength requirements).
	* Display optimization results graphically.
5. Multi-Axis Stress Analysis
	* Compute principal stresses and strains for multi-axial loading conditions.
	* Include a visual representation (e.g., Mohr’s Circle).
6. Safety Factor Calculator
	* Evaluate safety factors for stress conditions.
	* Automatically compare calculated stresses with material limits from the database.
7. Dynamic Plotting
	* Create real-time plots that update based on user input or simulated changes.
	* For example, dynamically adjust stress-strain curves as load values are varied.
8. Unit Conversion Tool
	* Provide a utility to convert between different units of stress, force, and area.
	* Integrate the tool seamlessly with other calculations.
9. Custom Report Generation
	* Generate and export reports summarizing inputs, calculations, and results.
	* Include charts or plots as part of the report.
10. Material Comparison
	* Compare stress-strain curves and properties for multiple materials side by side.
	* Highlight differences graphically or in tabular format.
