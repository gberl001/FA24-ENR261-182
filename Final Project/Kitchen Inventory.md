# Final Project: Smart Kitchen Management System

**Objective:**

Create a GUI-based application that integrates the kitchen management tools developed during the course. Students will implement core features and extend functionality by selecting additional tools/features.

## Core Requirements **(Mandatory)**

The following base features are required:
1. Basic Inventory Management
	* Add, remove, and update ingredients (or items).
	* Track quantities of items in an organized structure.
	* Include input validation (e.g., no negative quantities).
2. Recipe Management
	* Create recipes by defining a list of ingredients and their quantities.
	* Display recipe details in an intuitive format (e.g., tables or lists).
3. Recipe Usage
	* Deduct ingredients from the pantry based on selected recipes.
	* Notify the user if required ingredients are unavailable or insufficient.
4. GUI Integration
	* Create a GUI with tabs or sections for:
      * Inventory management
      * Recipe management

## Additional Features **(Choose 3)**

Select and implement three additional features from the following list:
1. Shopping List Generator
	* Automatically create a shopping list for missing ingredients based on recipes.
	* Allow exporting the list to a text file or Excel.
2. Consumption Tracking
	* Log and visualize ingredient usage over time.
	* Include a plot showing trends (e.g., a line chart or bar graph).
3. Optimal Batch Cooking
	* Suggest recipes that maximize ingredient usage (minimizing waste).
	* Account for expiration dates if included in the pantry.
4. Expiration Date Management
	* Add expiration dates for pantry items.
	* Include a notification system for soon-to-expire items.
5. Recipe Scaling
	* Add the ability to scale recipes (e.g., doubling or halving quantities).
	* Automatically adjust deductions from the pantry.
6. Ingredient Substitution
	* Suggest substitutions for missing ingredients.
	* Allow the user to specify preferences or common substitutions.
7. Nutritional Analysis
	* Calculate nutritional values (calories, macronutrients) for recipes.
	* Display the analysis in a clear format.
8. Budget Tracker
	* Track the cost of pantry items and recipes.
	* Display a running total of pantry and recipe expenses.
9. Recipe Recommendations
	* Recommend recipes based on available ingredients in the pantry.
	* Include a “surprise me” option for random suggestions.
10. Custom Reports
	* Generate and export reports summarizing pantry status, recipe usage, or shopping lists.

## Project Grading Criteria

1. **Core Functionality (50%):** Completeness and correctness of mandatory features.
2. **Additional Features (30%):** Implementation and integration of selected additional features.
3. **GUI Design and Usability (10%):** Logical layout, ease of use, and visual appeal.
4. **Code Quality and Documentation (10%):** Proper use of functions, modular design, and inline comments.
