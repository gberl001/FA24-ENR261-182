# Final Project: Physics Simulation and Analysis Toolbox

**Objective:**

Create a GUI-based application that integrates the physics tools developed during the course. Students will implement core features and extend functionality by selecting additional tools.

## Core Requirements **(Mandatory)**

The following base features are required:
1. Projectile Motion Simulator
	* Simulate the trajectory of a projectile based on user input (e.g., initial velocity, angle, air resistance).
	* Display key results such as maximum height, range, and flight time.
2. Data Analysis
	* Compute and display statistical properties of motion (e.g., maximum speed, peak apex, time to target).
	* Allow users to input or load data for analysis.
3. Data Visualization
	* Plot trajectories and annotate key points (e.g., max height, range).
	* Include customization options (e.g., gridlines, axis scaling).
4. GUI Integration
	* Create a GUI with tabs or sections for:
      * Projectile motion simulation.
      * Data analysis and statistics.
      * Plotting and visualization.

## Additional Features **(Choose 3)**

Select and implement three additional features from the following list:
1. Multi-Projectile Comparison
	* Simulate and compare trajectories for multiple projectiles.
	* Display results on the same plot for side-by-side analysis.
2. Dynamic Parameters
	* Allow real-time adjustment of parameters (e.g., wind speed, gravity) with immediate updates to simulations and plots.
3. Collision Simulation
	* Simulate elastic or inelastic collisions between objects.
	* Visualize results with position vs. time or energy vs. time plots.
4. Energy Analysis
	* Break down the motion into kinetic, potential, and total energy components.
	* Include a plot showing energy changes over time.
5. Custom Input Profiles
	* Enable users to load or save input profiles for projectile simulations.
	* Include file management for saving/loading profiles.
6. 3D Visualization
	* Extend plotting to 3D for scenarios like motion with wind drift.
	* Allow users to rotate and zoom in the plot window.
7. Statistical Comparison
	* Perform statistical analysis on multiple datasets (e.g., velocities from different experiments).
	* Display results graphically or in a table.
8. Physics Quiz Mode
	* Create a quiz feature that generates random problems related to projectile motion.
	* Evaluate user responses and provide feedback.
9. Numerical Integration
	* Implement numerical methods (e.g., Eulerâ€™s Method) for solving equations of motion.
	* Compare results with analytical solutions.
10. Custom Report Generation
	* Generate and export reports with inputs, calculations, and visualizations.
	* Include both text and graphical elements.
